# HAFAS (HaCon Fahrplan-Auskunfts-System) client
A custom component for Home Assistant providing a client for the HAFAS API.
It can be used to retrieve connection data for a number of public transport companies in Europe.

Credit goes to @kilimnik. This is just a proof of concept to use this component with HACS.
